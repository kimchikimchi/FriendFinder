our apiRoutes.js file should contain two routes:

A GET route with the url /api/friends. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
A POST routes /api/friends. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.

With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.
Example:
User 1: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = _5_
Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both 5-3 and 3-5 as 2, and so on.
The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
